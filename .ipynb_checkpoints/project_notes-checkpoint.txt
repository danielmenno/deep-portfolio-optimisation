Project:

IDEAS
- Experiment with different utility functions
- Maybe try big indices (S&P, FTSE,...)
- Transaction costs
- Non-markov setting / Rough volatility models
- Multi-dim real dependency structures
- Multi agent systems (agents trade a produce price processes) (Diff. games, mean field games, etc...)


QUESTIONS:
- What dynamics describe multiple price processes? Can we just turn alpha into a vector?
- Are there analytical solutions for multiple price processes?
- If not, how can we validate our solutions?
---> Closed form might exist for BS
---> Compare to mean/variance optimisation as benchmark
- Other models instead of Merton/Heston model?
- How does one generated (anti)-correlated price processes?
- Can we use real world data? Where would one find such data?
---> Yahoo finance (?) - Steven
- What are these dummy hedgeeval variables?


Meeting #1:
- Give update one contacting other members
- Write research proposal/plan outline (first steps)
- Steven set up git

Q&A:
- Find portfolio by maximisin
