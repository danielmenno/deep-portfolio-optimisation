Meeting minutes 05/05:

- Derive wealth price process
- Log of wealth progress:
     - Consider alpha<1 (self-financing)
     - If S goes to 0, drift vanishes? 
     - Ito is not necessary, just a speed up
- Change code to remove log?
- X will always be non-negative for all alpha
- Monte Carlo -> can go below zero?
- Loss functions penalies large alpha
- Optimal portfolio under insider trading
--> Play with probabilities of BM 
--> Substitute Geo BM with S_t vs LSTM vs input = t and t-1
- Network that includes signatures
- Incorporate Monte-Carlo into keras
- S path dependent
- sigma(t,S_t, S_{t-1})
- Paper from Wahid on robust/non-linear finance: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09152.pdf
