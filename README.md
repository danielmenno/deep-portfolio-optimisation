# Content
We consider a machine learning approach to the problem of portfolio optimisation, where the allocation map is learned at every timestep by a set of neural networks. The implementation relies on tensorflow keras in Tensorflow version 2.x. It is not guaranteed to run without issues in Tensorflow 1.

# Notebooks
The main code can be found in portfolio_main.ipynb. For the Vasicek model implementation please use portfolio_vasicek.ipynb.
